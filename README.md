# Password_Validation

The "Password Validator" project is a web application developed using JavaScript, CSS3, and HTML5 that provides users with a robust and secure way to validate the strength of their passwords. 

The Password Validator project leverages the power of JavaScript to analyze the user's input and provide real-time feedback on the strength and validity of the password. It employs a combination of rules and algorithms to assess the password's complexity, ensuring it meets the desired security standards.
